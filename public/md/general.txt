CSVKanban turns CSV files into a simple kanban board.
The data stays in the browser and on your local filesystem.
Contributions are welcome, see [GitHub](https://github.com/spmvg/csvkanban).

## Example
Take the following CSV file as an example.
There are 3 field names in the header of this particular example: _Task_, _Assignee_ and _State_.
The choice of the field names is up to you.

```
Task,Assignee,State
Make a business plan,Alice,2 In review
Acquire funding,Bob,1 In progress
Hire employees,Charlie,
Catering,Dan,3 Done
Marketing,,
```

This CSV file can be opened in CSVKanban.
The rows are turned into items on the board.

![Example item.](../example_item.png "Example item.") 

Initially, all items will be placed in the leftmost column since no field has been selected in the dropdown.
Use the dropdown to select which field will be used to display the items as columns in the kanban board.
In this example, let's choose the _State_ field for the columns of the kanban board.

![Example kanban board.](../example_kanban_board.png "Example kanban board.")

Note that the values of the _State_ field are now the columns of the kanban board.
The columns of the kanban board are sorted lexographically.
The items without a value in the _State_ field are still in the leftmost column.
As with the field names, the choice of the columns of the kanban board is up to you.

You can modify the data in the kanban board:
* Drag items between columns,
* Modify fields,
* Add/delete items.

When you're done, save the board back to CSV by clicking the save icon.
